StackExercise
=============

A simple programming exercise for use with pair programming.  The objective is to create a LIFO (last in first out) stack with push and pop methods.  Ruby arrays already provide these methods, so if doing the exercise in Ruby it is pretty straightforward.  The exercise can be made tougher by not using the existing methods, but the key is to be following the TDD (Test Driven Development) methodology, of only writing code in the main application when testing code has been written that demands it.

In particular we recommend trying this exercise with one of the following pair programming protocols:

* Ping Pong
* Change the Error
* One Undermanship

Or some combination of the three.  Here is a live example focused mainly on the "Change the Error" protocol:
